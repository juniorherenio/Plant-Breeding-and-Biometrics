# Multi-Generation Common Bean Breeding Analysis

## Study Overview
This analysis evaluates selection efficiency in common bean breeding by connecting sequential trials under different experimental designs. The study addresses key challenges in plant breeding programs, particularly genetic and statistical imbalance across generations.

## Research Objectives
- Assess the impact of grain yield data (kg ha⁻¹) on selection accuracy
- Compare statistical models for analyzing multi-generation breeding data
- Improve genetic gain estimation in unbalanced breeding trials

## Experimental Design
### Trial Phases
1. **Initial Evaluation (F4:6 Generation)**:
   - 400 progenies
   - 20 trials using randomized complete block design (RCBD)
   - Conducted during 2019 dry season (Southeast Brazil)

2. **Advanced Evaluation**:
   - 95 selected progenies
   - Triple 10 × 10 lattice design
   - Three growing seasons:
     - Rainy season 2019
     - Winter 2020
     - Rainy season 2020

## Statistical Approach
Five mixed models were compared, differing in their (co)variance structures for:
- Residual variances
- Genetic components across generations

### Key Findings
- **Optimal Model**: First-order factor analytic structure for progenies with heterogeneous residual variances
- **Genetic Gain**: 68% higher than traditional models
- **Heritability**: Significant improvement in estimation accuracy
- **Classification**: Notable changes in progeny rankings across seasons

## Practical Implications
- Provides more accurate genetic parameter estimates
- Better handles genetic and statistical imbalance
- Enhances selection efficiency in breeding programs
- Contributes to development of superior common bean varieties
